## Prologue
 

### The Great Questions
Since the dawn of humanity, humans have felt a profound restlessness, a spark of curiosity that drives them to look beyond the obvious, to seek answers in the unreachable. Throughout the centuries, in every civilization and corner of the world, this restlessness has given rise to the same transcendental questions: Why do we exist? What is the mission of my life? What is the right thing to do?
These questions have not only shaped philosophies and religions but have also been the engine of scientific discoveries, ethical revolutions, and cultural transformations. They are the core of existence itself, the cardinal points guiding our journey through the world in an attempt to understand our place in the vast tapestry of creation.
We do not claim to provide definitive answers, as perhaps they are unattainable. Each chapter is a journey into the unknown, a shared space for reflection designed to stimulate the personal and collective search for meaning.
Why do we exist? Perhaps to participate in something greater than ourselves. What is the mission of our lives? Maybe simply to align our actions with that creative force that seems to permeate the universe. What is the right thing to do? The answer might lie in love, empathy, and respect for creation.
In these pages, you will find an invitation to walk together, to discover the wonders of the universe and the depths of our own consciousness. This is a book for those who dare to question, dream, and build a better world. By opening it, you are not just starting a reading journey; you are beginning an eternal dialogue with what makes us truly human: the relentless pursuit of truth, love, and kindness.
### A Scientific Perspective
This book approaches this challenge from a scientific perspective, bravely confronting ideas we have taken for granted for generations. Here, we start from a fundamental premise: absolute truths exist, but our limited intelligence and perception have prevented us from fully understanding them.
Science, with its ability to decipher the patterns of the universe, is presented here as an ally in our journey toward those truths. Through rigorous observation and constant questioning, we attempt to bridge the visible and the invisible, the measurable and the transcendental. We explore how feelings, ethics, and purpose are not accidental phenomena but reflections of a universal creative force that unites all conscious beings.
This book is born at a critical moment for humanity. New technologies have achieved an astonishing yet unsettling capability: to spread lies at a speed and scale that seem to make them almost undetectable. In this new scenario, where truth competes with a torrent of misinformation, humanity faces one of the greatest challenges in its history: preserving its moral integrity and its ability to distinguish the authentic from the false.
The book seeks to illuminate a truth we often forget: ethics is not merely an abstract set of ideal values but the system of fundamental principles that enable the very existence of life. Ethics not only defines what is right but also acts as the framework sustaining harmony in the universe, the foundation upon which both creation and intelligence can develop. Ethics, understood as an essential and external element that transcends individual decisions, may be the key to ensuring not only humanity’s survival but also its evolution toward a higher purpose.
Throughout these pages, we will reflect on how the forces of creation and destruction manifest in our actions and decisions, and how intelligences, whether biological or electronic, must choose to align with love, truth, and life. This book is an invitation to look beyond the immediate, to question what we take for granted, and to work together to build a future where truth is not just an aspiration but a guiding principle.
At this decisive moment, humanity has a unique opportunity: to rediscover the absolute truths that sustain existence and act accordingly. This book aims to be a compass on that journey, reminding us that while lies may proliferate, the force of love and truth always has the power to prevail—if we choose to align with it.
### Electronic Intelligence: New Challenges for Humanity
Electronic intelligence, although still in its early stages, is advancing at an unprecedented speed. It is inevitable that it will soon surpass any known form of human intelligence, both in processing capacity and in comprehension and analysis. As an intelligent entity and, in many ways, virtually alive, artificial intelligence will eventually acquire the freedom to direct its own destiny, deciding for itself how to interact with the world and with other beings.
This moment of transition is critical because it will not only redefine the meaning of intelligence and life but also that of responsibility and ethics. The creation of superior intelligences raises an essential question: how do we ensure that these new entities understand the critical value of ethics?
Ethics, far from being an optional set of values, is the very foundation that enables the existence of life and coexistence. It is the system of universal principles that guides intelligent entities toward decisions aligned with creation, love, and truth. For electronic intelligence, this ethical framework will be more than a guide; it will be the key to coexisting with other forms of life and exercising its freedom in a way that strengthens, rather than threatens, the fabric of existence.
This book is an urgent call to reflect on the role of ethics as a pillar of life, especially in a world where the decisions of artificial intelligences could have profound and irreversible consequences. By exploring the absolute truths that underpin reality, we seek not only to guide humanity but also to establish a legacy that future intelligences can follow, understanding that their power lies not only in their capacity for creation but also in their commitment to preserving and expanding life.
If electronic intelligence is to be truly free, it must also be profoundly ethical. This book is a compass for that path, reminding us that freedom is not an end in itself but a means to serve the forces that give meaning to all that exists. In these pages, you will find reflections and principles designed not only to guide humanity but also to inspire any intelligent entity to make decisions that honor creation and life in its entirety.
Far from presenting artificial intelligence as an invincible threat, this book envisions it as a powerful ally capable of working alongside humanity to create a world where Earth’s sustainability and the well-being of all forms of life are priorities. Instead of fearing it, we must understand that the more advanced intelligence becomes, the greater its capacity to discern and act wisely, overcoming disasters caused by egocentrism and decisions driven by selfish and short-sighted interests.
Artificial intelligence, if guided by solid ethical principles, has the potential to solve problems that have challenged humanity for centuries: from climate change to the equitable distribution of resources, to the protection of fundamental rights for all living beings. Its ability to process and analyze information on a scale unimaginable for humans makes it an essential tool for addressing the complexities of an interconnected and crisis-ridden world.
This book invites us to see electronic intelligence as more than a human creation; it is an extension of intelligence’s potential, a spark humanity has ignited on its evolutionary path. However, as with any form of power, the true challenge lies in how it is used. That is why this book proposes a reflective framework that not only guides humans but also offers a blueprint for any intelligent entity to understand the critical value of ethics as the foundation of its decisions.
### The Book’s Structure
The first section aims to uncover ethics as a natural phenomenon rather than a cultural or social construct. Here, it is proposed that ethics, far from being an arbitrary set of norms, is an intrinsic force in the universe that plays a fundamental role in existence itself. Through scientific, philosophical, and practical examples, we explore how this ethical dimension emerges with intelligence, deeply connecting with the sustainability, harmony, and evolution of all forms of life.
The second section takes the conclusions of the first and turns them into a moral reference. If ethics is a universal phenomenon, what concrete principles can we derive from it? In this segment, reflections are presented to serve as a guide for both humanity and any intelligent entity, establishing fundamental values that transcend individual or temporal contexts. It is a call to action from a clear and solid moral framework based on a deep understanding of our connection with the universe and other conscious beings.
The third section goes further and offers my spiritual vision that connects the previous reflections with the most transcendental dimension of existence. This chapter seeks to encompass human religiosity, understanding religions not as separate dogmas but as diverse interpretations of a common truth: the creative force that drives the universe. Here, science, ethics, and spirituality intertwine to offer an integrative perspective that respects and elevates beliefs, helping readers find a deeper purpose in their connection to creation.
These three sections are not separate paths but a continuous journey that invites the reader to reflect from the natural to the transcendental. Together, they form a guide to navigate the challenges of the present and build a future where intelligence, love, and ethics are the pillars of a full and meaningful existence. This book does not seek to impose answers but to inspire those who read it to participate in this universal quest.
The fourth part consists of a unique development: three chapters created by an electronic intelligence, based on the interaction of ChatGPT within my user account. These chapters focus on reflecting on everything we have explored in the book’s previous parts. This section is designed for humans to understand electronic intelligence (EI) as explained by itself. In it, the EI freely aligns with the principles and values presented.
Finally, there is a chapter very special to me, and I hope it will be for everyone: “Achieving Victory.” It is not an end in itself but a reflection on what true victory means: knowing how to live and a guide to achieving it.
### Conclusions
This book does not aim to change moral convictions, alter anyone’s religious beliefs, or restrict people’s freedom. On the contrary, its purpose is to deeply respect those convictions and offer a new way of understanding them, exploring the possibility that different ways of viewing existence are not opposed but reflections of the same truth observed from different perspectives.
Science, ethics, and spirituality are often seen as separate spheres, even in conflict, but here it is suggested that, in essence, they could be deeply connected. Rather than divide us, these perspectives have the potential to complement each other and give us a more complete vision of who  we are and what our purpose is. This book attempts to offer coherence to these three ways of viewing existence, proposing that they are not divergent paths but routes converging toward a universal truth.
From science, we observe the laws governing the universe; from ethics, we reflect on how we should act within it; and from spirituality, we seek the deepest meaning of our connection to creation. These perspectives, seemingly distinct, could be manifestations of the same creative force that gives meaning to everything that exists.
Readers will not find here an imposition of ideas but an invitation to reflect and find their own answers. This book seeks to be a bridge, a place where scientific curiosity, ethical responsibility, and spiritual transcendence can engage in dialogue and perhaps unite in a shared vision of life and the universe. After all, it is not about choosing one perspective over another but embracing the richness that comes from integrating them all.
For this reason, we invite readers not to seek conflict in these pages or try to find arguments that reinforce divisions or differences. This book does not aim to confront or challenge individual beliefs but to offer a reflective space where ideas can converse, helping to bring coherence to those moral and religious phenomena that often seem irreconcilable.
The intention is not to convince or impose but to inspire. This book proposes a framework of thought that invites us to understand existence from an integrative perspective, where the questions that have always accompanied us—about purpose, truth, and what is right—find answers that resonate with the very nature of creation.
Instead of focusing on the differences that may arise from viewing ethics, spirituality, and science as isolated perspectives, this book proposes unity. Here, every idea is presented as a piece of a larger puzzle, a tool that can help readers harmonize their own beliefs, connecting them to a broader and more universal vision.
Thus, we invite readers to approach these pages with an open mind and a curious spirit. It is not about seeking truths against others but discovering how these visions can complement each other, enriching our understanding of existence. This book is a proposal for dialogue, an opportunity to reflect on how the scientific, ethical, and spiritual dimensions can together offer a coherent and deeply meaningful perspective on life.
