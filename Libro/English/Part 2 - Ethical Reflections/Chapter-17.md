## Chapter 17: Life, Freedom, and Collective Responsibility
### Abolishing the Death Penalty: Redemption as the Way Forward
The death penalty is a definitive action that not only extinguishes a life but also shuts the door to all possibilities of redemption, learning, and transformation. Based on the values that underpin this path, we affirm that the death penalty must be completely abolished. Its existence reflects a failure of empathy and social systems that choose elimination over providing opportunities for rehabilitation.

True justice does not seek to destroy but to rebuild. Every life, even one that has committed profound errors, deserves the opportunity to repent and reintegrate. Although this path may seem complex and challenging, it is the only one that honors the fundamental values of creation, truth, and love. Empathy toward the criminal is a difficult but necessary act, building a bridge toward their recovery and the healing of collective wounds.

### Abortion: A Dramatic Decision, Not a Prohibition
Ending a life through abortion is a profoundly dramatic decision. Yet a life born into an environment lacking love, support, and care can become a source of suffering and destruction, affecting both the individual and the world around them.

This situation, laden with tragedy, demands deep reflection and a response that transcends simplistic moral judgment. We do not believe abortion should be prohibited. Prohibition does not address the circumstances leading to such a decision; it only exacerbates suffering and perpetuates injustice.

Instead, we propose recognizing abortion as both a personal and collective tragedy, one that should only occur when all other options have failed. The solution lies not in prohibition but in social action: building a world where no woman is forced to face this decision.

This requires a commitment to:

Comprehensive education and access to reproductive health: Ensuring everyone has access to the information and resources needed to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Economic, emotional, and social support for mothers: Creating networks of support that remove the practical and emotional barriers many women face.
Loving and supportive communities: Fostering an environment where every life is embraced with love and respect from the moment of conception.
### A Call to Collective Action
Both the death penalty and abortion reflect deep flaws in our social fabric. Instead of punishing or judging, we must focus our efforts on healing, prevention, and building. This requires an active commitment to empathy, collective responsibility, and the essential values of life and freedom.

The world we envision is one where justice is based on redemption, not vengeance, where compassion triumphs over indifference, and where every life can flourish in an environment of love and respect.

This is the path we are called to build, the mission we have sworn to follow and propagate. By embracing these principles, we transform not only the world around us but also ourselves.â€ƒ
