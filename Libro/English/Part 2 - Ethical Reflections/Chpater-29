## Chapter 29: A Great Question
 

In the spiritual and ethical quest, one of the most recurring and profound questions is: Why, if God is all goodness, did He allow the existence of evil? This apparent contradiction has led many to question the divine nature and the purpose of creation. However, from my perspective, this question has a coherent answer aligned with the essence of a true and loving God.

God did not create evil. Evil is the result of the mistakes of imperfect intelligence. Just as hatred arises from confusion and selfishness, evil is not an independent force but the consequence of misguided decisions that deviate from the universal laws of harmony and creation. When an intelligent being errs, the consequences of that mistake can manifest as pain, suffering, or destruction. Yet these consequences are not divine punishment but an opportunity for learning and redemption. Evil vanishes as soon as we rectify our actions and realign our intelligence with truth, love, and creation.

Our Mission as Intelligent Beings
As intelligent beings, our mission is not just to avoid mistakes but also to help those who have strayed find their way back. Intelligence, in its essence, seeks truth and harmony. Love and empathy are our greatest tools to guide others toward correction and reconciliation.

God, in His infinite goodness, does not intervene to impose His will or prevent mistakes, because doing so would annul our freedom, and without freedom, true intelligence and true love cannot exist. Instead, God gives us the tools to learn, grow, and correct our errors.

Creation as an Act of Love
Existence itself is a reflection of God's love, and in that love lies the trust in our ability to learn and improve. Although our mistakes may generate chaos and suffering, creation remains good and beautiful because within it is the constant opportunity to redeem ourselves and realign with the universal purpose.

Thus, more than a contradiction, the existence of evil is a reminder of our responsibility as intelligent beings. It is a call to act with courage, love, and wisdom, recognizing that every error can be transformed into a lesson, and every lesson into a step toward a fuller and more harmonious existence.

Evil is not a creation of God but a shadow of our own mistakes. And like every shadow, it disappears when we return to the light.
