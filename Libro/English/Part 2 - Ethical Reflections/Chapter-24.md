## Chapter 24: The Creative Force and the Encounter with God
At the beginning of this third section, I wish to approach, with humility and reverence, a reality that, while deeply personal, feels inseparable from all that we are and the universe we inhabit. My initial intention in exploring these ideas was not to seek God but to understand why ethics affected me so tangibly, almost physically. However, my empirical analyses and ethical reflections unexpectedly led me to conclusions pointing to something many religions have defined as God. Today, I not only believe in God; I cannot conceive of existence without Him. What began as an intellectual pursuit ultimately transformed into a transcendent encounter.

### A Convergence of Three Visions
Throughout my life, I have viewed science as the most precise tool for understanding reality. At the same time, I have felt ethics influence me in ways that transcend words or abstract values. Religion, though often incomprehensible to me, also seemed like a source of truth. Through personal and empirical experience, I have come to reconcile these three perspectives: science, ethics, and religion. Now I see them as parts of the same reality, intimately connected. This understanding has allowed me to find meaning in life and rediscover sacred texts from a perspective I never had before.

### From Logic to Transcendence
In the earlier sections of this book, I presented arguments rooted in objective and verifiable facts—though sometimes controversial, as they may challenge autonomy and individual freedom. I also explored ethical conclusions derived from these principles, creating a logical framework for understanding our interaction with the world.

However, this third section is different. Here, we delve into a transcendent vision, deeply subjective yet one I feel is as real and powerful as the other two. This vision acknowledges the existence of a creative force, inspired by love, that gives meaning and happiness to the world. This creative force, which many call God, not only guides existence but is its foundation. Although various religions offer their own descriptions and paths to this reality, they all seem to point toward the same universal truth.

### Religion and Universal Harmony
Having grown up within Christianity, my perspective is inevitably influenced by this tradition. However, the harmony of the universe—a concept I have mentioned frequently—is deeply connected with other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. These traditions provide valuable insights into achieving union with the divine and living in harmony with creation.

It is important to emphasize that this section does not aim to impose dogmas or establish truths others must follow. Instead, it offers a personal example, an invitation to reflect on how a transcendent vision of God does not conflict with the world we live in but provides a deeper understanding of reality.

### Final Reflection: A Unity in Love
The purpose of this third section is to bring coherence to the three realities that influence human existence: science, ethics, and religion. In doing so, I hope to show how these dimensions, far from contradicting each other, complement one another. At their core, they all seem to converge on love as a creative force, a source of happiness, and the sustenance of the universe.

This vision is not intended to be absolute or universal but profoundly sincere. It is a testimony of how, by transcending concepts, I discovered that the creative force we call God is not only present in everything but also gives meaning to all that we are and do.

May this chapter serve as a doorway to explore, with respect and openness, the connection between our lives and the infinite.
