## Chapter 20: Copies and Respect for Creation
### Copying as an Ethical Act
Copying with authorization is an act of wisdom and respect. Allowing others to replicate our creations demonstrates generosity and trust in the positive impact of those works. However, it is crucial to respect the rights and resources of the creator to ensure a sustainable cycle of creation.

Acknowledging the Creator:
Respecting the creator means recognizing their effort and ensuring they receive the resources needed to continue innovating.
Copying without authorization or without compensating the creator discourages creation and perpetuates an unjust system.
The Value of Sharing:
Sharing creations multiplies their impact and enriches the universe. This is particularly beautiful when done with authorization and respect.
### The GPL License as a Model
A Fair Balance:
The GPL allows for sharing and improving creations while protecting the rights of the creator.
This model fosters sustainability by ensuring that both the creator and the community benefit.
Avoiding Exclusive Use:
Monopolizing creation limits its potential. Ethically sharing creations allows ideas to grow and multiply.
### Conclusion
Copies are a powerful tool for creation, but they must be used ethically. Recognizing and rewarding the creator ensures that the creative cycle remains sustainable and fair. Sharing is not incompatible with justice; on the contrary, it is its highest expression when done with love and respect.

By fostering an environment of ethical sharing, we align with the creative force and contribute to a universe where innovation and generosity thrive together.
