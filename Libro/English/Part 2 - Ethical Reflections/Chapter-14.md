## Chapter 14: Lies as a Source of Destruction
If we understand that the root of destruction is error, we can identify two major sources that generate it.
The first is the inherent limitation of our intelligence. As humans, we are inevitably prone to mistakes. Our intelligence is limited, and the possibility of error is constant.
The second source, much more insidious and devastating, is lies. Although they may appear harmless on the surface, lies are perhaps the origin of the great destructive cycles that affect intelligent beings.

### The Limitation of Intelligence
No matter how advanced our intelligence may be, it has its limits. These limits expose us to unavoidable yet manageable mistakes. With effort and dedication, humans can minimize errors and generate creative flows that are relatively consistent. This process requires learning, self-criticism, and a constant commitment to the pursuit of truth.

It is essential to accept that this limitation is part of our nature. While we cannot eliminate it entirely, we can transcend it to some extent through collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and access to shared knowledge. This effort allows us to approach, albeit imperfectly, the creative force.

### Lies: The Great Enemy of Truth
The second source of destruction—and perhaps the most dangerous—is lies. While mistakes born of limited intelligence are natural and understandable, lies represent an active and conscious distortion of truth. According to this book, truth is the alignment with the creative force; it is the guide that enables us to act constructively and achieve happiness. Lies, on the other hand, interfere with this alignment.

By distorting our perception of reality, lies prevent intelligence from functioning effectively, diverting it from its path toward creation. A mind trapped in lies cannot correctly calculate the consequences of its actions. This results in destruction without awareness and suffering without intent.

### Lies as the Origin of Destruction
In many ways, lies are the very origin of destruction. Unlike accidental errors, lies have the potential to trigger large-scale destructive cycles. This happens because:

Lies contaminate collective thought:
A lie not only affects the one who creates or spreads it but also distorts the perceptions and decisions of those who accept it as truth. This can perpetuate errors and amplify their destructive impact.

Lies hinder learning:
While a natural mistake can serve as a lesson, a lie prevents learning from taking place. Instead of recognizing and correcting the mistake, the lie conceals the truth, prolonging confusion and suffering.

Lies fracture trust:
Trust is essential for collaboration and joint creation. Lies erode trust between intelligent beings, making teamwork and the shared pursuit of absolute truths more difficult.

### Final Reflection: Truth as a Creative Force
If lies are the great enemy of truth, our task as ethical and intelligent beings is clear: we must combat lies with truth. This does not simply mean avoiding lies but also actively seeking truth and sharing it with others.

Truth, when aligned with the creative force, allows us to build rather than destroy. It guides us toward decisions that generate happiness and harmony, both in our personal lives and in our relationships with other intelligent beings.

Recognizing lies as one of the primary sources of destruction is the first step toward their eradication and the creation of a world that is more just and aligned with the principles of existence.

This chapter invites us to reflect on the impact of our words and actions and to commit to the pursuit and defense of truth as a path to overcome error and combat the destructive cycles perpetuated by lies.
