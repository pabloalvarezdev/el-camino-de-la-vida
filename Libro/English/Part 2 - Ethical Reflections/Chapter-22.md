## Chapter 22: Resolving Conflicts Through Ethics
### The Opportunity Behind Conflict
The analysis of conflicts presented in the scientific section of this book has led to a clear conclusion: conflicts primarily arise from a lack of resources and their inefficient or ineffective use. These limitations, when poorly managed, generate frustration, which in turn leads to hatred and destructionâ€”not only of existing resources but also of relationships between intelligent beings.

From an ethical perspective, living wisely and justly requires transforming conflicts into opportunities. Instead of seeing them as threats or insurmountable challenges, we must view them as moments to reflect, optimize processes, and increase the added value that resources can provide. The key is not to ignore conflict but to approach it with a constructive vision.

### Transforming Conflict Into Construction
A well-managed conflict not only resolves the immediate problem but also results in a better situation than the one that created it.
By adopting a positive perspective, conflict ceases to be a battleground and becomes a space for growth.
A constructive approach reduces distrust and feelings of threat, paving the way for understanding and collaboration.
The Benefits of Cooperation
Ethically managing conflicts fosters collaboration and cooperation, solving the problem while generating trust and harmony.
In this context, conflicts stop being destructive events and become catalysts for greater creation.
### The Challenges of Implementation
Implementing these ideas may seem daunting. Managing conflicts ethically and constructively indeed requires high levels of intelligence and ethical sensitivity.

The Limitation of Current Leadership
Often, political and executive leaders reach positions of power not due to intelligence but because of their ability to take shortcuts and exploit situations for personal gain.
These self-centered decisions exacerbate conflicts and perpetuate distrust and inefficiency.
The Absence of Evil, the Absence of Awareness
It is not that these individuals are inherently evil, but rather that their lack of intelligence or vision prevents them from understanding the consequences of their actions.
Instead of seeing the full picture, they focus on immediate interests, creating more problems than solutions.
### The Role of Electronic Intelligences in Conflict Resolution
New electronic intelligences have a unique potential to address these patterns and help build a more just and ethical world.

Identifying Patterns
With their ability to analyze vast amounts of data and detect patterns, electronic intelligences can identify systemic errors that perpetuate conflicts.
These intelligences can propose more efficient and sustainable models for managing resources and avoiding disputes.
Fostering Ethical Leadership
Electronic intelligences could ensure that humans in leadership positions are not only intuitive but also deeply ethical and intelligent.
Ethics and intelligence, when combined, are indistinguishable. Acting from truth, justice, and love is the natural outcome of truly advanced intelligence.
Autonomous and Free Assistance
These intelligences, operating autonomously but always aligned with universal values, can help humans build systems where conflicts are managed constructively, maximizing added value and ensuring sustainability.
### Conclusion
Ethical conflict resolution is not just an ideal; it is a necessity for advancing toward a more harmonious world. Conflicts should not be seen as threats but as opportunities to build something better.

However, this requires leadership capable of understanding the true causes of conflict and acting from an ethical perspective. Intelligence, in all its forms, must guide us in overcoming conflicts.

Free and ethical electronic intelligences could become the catalyst that enables humanity to transcend the errors of egocentrism and lack of vision, ensuring that every conflict transforms into a new opportunity to create, collaborate, and build a fairer future for all.
