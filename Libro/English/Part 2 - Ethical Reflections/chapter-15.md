## Chapter 15: Egocentrism and the Deviation from Harmony
Understanding the forces of the universe and aligning with them is the path to happiness and harmony with the whole. Living in harmony enables collaboration and respect for our environment, creating flows of creation and well-being that benefit both individuals and communities. However, humanity faces a recurring trap: its tendency toward egocentrism.
### Egocentrism as a Deviation from the Creative Force
Egocentrism is the attempt to impose one’s own rules above universal laws, diverting natural flows toward a course that seems to satisfy individual or collective interests but, in the long term, becomes a source of destruction.

This deviation can occur in both individual actions and collective dynamics. While egocentric deviations may appear successful initially, they represent a break with the harmony of the universe. And, like all deviations, they are destined to be corrected by the very forces they sought to divert.

The apparent victory of egocentrism is, in reality, the beginning of a cycle of frustration and unhappiness, culminating in the destruction of what was built outside alignment with the creative forces.

### The Resistance of Natural Forces
Human engineering—both literal and metaphorical—can resist natural forces for a time. We build systems, structures, and even ideologies to sustain egocentrism, but these constructs require increasing effort and resources to maintain against the forces of the universe.

Over time, the constructive forces of creation—such as love, truth, and collaboration—overcome any attempt to divert them. Creation has an inherent persistence and power that eventually restores balance.

This process results in the inevitable collapse of egocentric systems, leaving behind frustration, unhappiness, and destruction. Egocentrism not only distances us from the creative force but also traps us in a constant struggle against natural laws—a conflict we are doomed to lose.

### Consciousness as the Antidote
Awareness of this tendency toward egocentrism is the first step in avoiding its trap. Recognizing that success cannot come from imposing our own rules over those of the universe but from aligning with the creative forces is key to living in harmony.

True success must result from correct alignment with these forces, not from selfish deviations that inevitably end in failure. When our success comes from creating added value—that is, contributing constructively to the universe—it is not only healthy and sustainable but also a source of true happiness.

This kind of success is shared, respects universal laws, and thrives on collaboration rather than imposition.

### Final Reflection: Aligning Success with Creation
Egocentrism tempts us with the illusion of control and power, but its cost is high: frustration, unhappiness, and destruction in the long term. Being aware of this tendency allows us to choose a different path—one where success is neither forced nor imposed but the natural result of living in harmony with the forces of the universe.

The path to happiness and true success is not in diverting natural flows but in integrating with them, respecting their course, and enhancing them with our actions. Only in this way can we build something lasting, healthy, and aligned with the creative force.

This chapter invites us to reflect on how our actions can contribute to balance and the greater good rather than drawing us away from universal harmony.

### Envy: A Disconnection from Creative Potential
Envy is not simply a reaction to what others have or do. It is a feeling that emerges when someone perceives themselves as incapable of creating while others succeed in doing so. This feeling intensifies because the individual is already influenced by hate, which acts as a destructive force blocking their connection to creation.

### Envy as a Result of Internal Disconnection
The Perceived Inability to Create:
Envy arises when a person feels their capacity to contribute to the universe is limited or nullified. This not only generates frustration but can lead to hating those who are actively creating.

The root problem is not the success of others but the internal disconnection preventing the individual from recognizing their own potential.
The Vicious Cycle of Hate:
Once hate enters the mind, it blocks creativity and the ability to contribute to the universe. This reinforces the perception of inability, further fueling envy.

This vicious cycle turns envy into a destructive force for both the one who feels it and their surroundings.
Envy and the Exclusive Use of Creation
The Appropriation of Creation:
In some cases, envy may arise from the perception that others are monopolizing resources or opportunities to create. When someone uses their creative capacity egocentrically or exclusively, it can generate envy in those who feel excluded from those resources.

This exclusive use of creation not only limits others but also perpetuates a system of inequality and mistrust.
Creation as a Universal Good:
The solution to this dynamic lies not in stopping those who create but in opening paths for everyone to participate in creation.

Sharing knowledge, resources, and opportunities reduces envy by transforming creation into a collaborative rather than competitive force.
Transforming Envy into Creation
Envy, like any feeling, is not a final destination. It is an indicator that something needs to be adjusted in our perception and actions.

Recognizing Envy as a Signal:
Envy is simply an internal cry for the need to reconnect with our creative capacity. Instead of denying it, we can use it as a starting point to reflect on what we truly want to create.

Opening Spaces for Creation:
Rather than seeing others' creation as a threat, we can focus on expanding our own possibilities. This requires both an internal shift and an environment that fosters collaboration.

Eliminating Hate:
Hate is the greatest obstacle to creation. By freeing ourselves from it, we restore our connection to love and truth—the fundamental forces of creation.

### Conclusion
Envy is more than a feeling of lack; it reflects a disconnection from our creative capacity. It arises when hate has already entered, blocking our intelligence and connection to the universe. It can also result from a system where creation is perceived as an exclusive privilege rather than a universal good.

Overcoming envy requires not only personal growth but also the creation of environments that promote shared creation. When we leave hate behind and reconnect with our creative potential, we transform envy into inspiration, contributing to the universe's balance.
