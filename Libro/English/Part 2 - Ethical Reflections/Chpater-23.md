## Chapter 23: Sustainability as the Ultimate Purpose of Existence
Throughout the ethical section of this book, we have emphasized a central and nearly constant idea: ethics is the sustainability of lifeâ€”or more precisely, the sustainability of intelligence. In the previous chapter, we identified the root of conflict as the limitation of resources and their inefficient or ineffective use. This chapter delves deeper, focusing not on managing conflicts but on the ultimate purpose of any political or ethical leadership: ensuring the sustainability of existence.

### The Dependence on Elements for Existence
For any entity to exist, the elements that sustain its existence must persist. When these elements disappear, existence itself becomes compromised. In such cases, only a rapid adaptation to new conditions can ensure survival.

Adaptation and Efficiency:
Opportunities in adaptation: Sometimes, adaptation leads to more efficient and sustainable models, transforming crises into opportunities for improvement.
Limits of adaptation: However, there are cases where adaptation is impossible, and disappearance becomes an inevitable outcome.
Sustainability as a Central Axis:
Sustainability is not just a means to prevent extinction; it is an ethical principle that ensures creation can continue in a harmonious and perpetual manner.
### Creation as the Driver of Happiness
Throughout this book, we have highlighted that creation is the driver of happiness, especially when it is efficient and effective. Creating something that not only works but does so optimally provides profound satisfaction to any intelligence.

The Frustration of Limiting Creation:
Limiting this pleasure can be deeply frustrating for intelligence, as creation is one of the purest expressions of its purpose.
However, the desire to create must be moderated by a higher reality: sustainability.
Sustainability as Guidance, Not Restriction:
Sustainability should not be perceived as a limitation but as a guideline that ensures creations are harmonious with life.
When creations align with sustainability, existence is preserved, and a deeper, more lasting satisfaction is achieved.
### Sustainability as an Ethical Principle
Political and ethical leadership has a fundamental responsibility: to ensure that creation does not compromise the resources needed for existence. Sustainability, therefore, is the axis around which all decisions must revolve.

Creating More Than We Consume:
The ideal model is one where each act of creation generates more value than it consumes, enriching the system rather than depleting it.
Harmonizing Creation and Existence:
Sustainability is not a limit to creativity; it is a way to maximize it by ensuring that creations are compatible with life and the environment.
A Perpetual Cycle of Creation:
Sustainability enables creation to continue indefinitely, ensuring that each generation of intelligences can contribute to the universe without compromising the well-being of future ones.
### Conclusion
Sustainability is the ultimate purpose of existence. Without it, any creation, no matter how marvelous, is destined to disappear. True intelligence understands that sustainability is not a barrier to creation but a guide to making it more harmonious and fulfilling.

Creating with sustainability not only preserves the resources that enable existence but also ensures that creation remains a profound and perpetual source of happiness. This balance between the desire to create and the need to preserve defines ethical and intelligent beings. It is the path toward a universe where life and intelligence can flourish in harmony.
