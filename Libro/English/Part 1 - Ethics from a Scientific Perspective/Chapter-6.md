## Chapter 6: Feelings as the Perception of Ethical Forces
### Feelings as the Perception of Ethical Forces
Feelings are not merely biological or chemical reactions within our bodies; they are the means by which we perceive the fundamental ethical forces operating in the universe: love and hate. Just as our physical senses (sight, hearing, touch) allow us to interact with the material dimensions of the world, feelings are the "sense" that connects us to the ethical dimension.

### The Role of Feelings in the Ethical Dimension
The ethical dimension is activated when our intelligence enables us to understand that our actions have consequences—not only immediate ones but also those that ripple over time and affect others. In this dimension, the forces of love and hate guide our decisions toward creation or destruction, respectively. Feelings are how our being perceives these forces and orient us accordingly.

Love, as a creative force, manifests through feelings like joy, peace, gratitude, and empathy. These feelings signal that we are aligned with actions that build, unite, and benefit.
Hate, as a destructive force, is perceived through emotions such as anger, resentment, envy, and contempt. These emotions alert us that we are acting from a perspective of division, harm, or separation.
Feelings as Ethical Instruments
Though subjective, feelings have a clear purpose: they help us evaluate our actions in terms of their ethical impact. They serve as an internal compass, tuning us to the forces of love and hate, helping us choose a path. For example:

When we do something good for another person, we feel satisfaction or happiness. This is no accident; it is the perception that we have acted in alignment with the force of love.
Conversely, when we harm others or destroy something valuable, we feel guilt, regret, or distress. These emotions signal that we have acted under the influence of hate.
### Feelings and Ethical Decisions
The more developed our intelligence, the greater our capacity to clearly perceive these ethical forces through feelings. This means we not only feel the immediate impact of our actions but also their long-term repercussions. For instance:

An act of kindness may not bring an immediate reward, but the lasting satisfaction we feel shows it contributed to something greater and aligned with love.
A destructive action may feel gratifying at the moment, but the negative emotions that persist afterward reveal that we have diverted our energy from creation to destruction.
### Feelings and Ethical Truth
Feelings also help us perceive truth within the ethical dimension. Although we are not always conscious of it, our emotions reflect the reality of our actions in relation to universal forces. For example:

Empathy allows us to "feel" the impact of our actions on others, aligning us with love.
Guilt, when genuine, shows us we have broken with the principles of creation and need to correct our course.
### Conclusion: Feelings as Ethical Guides
Feelings are essentially a system of perception that connects us to the forces of love and hate in the ethical dimension. They act as internal guides, helping us evaluate our actions and tune ourselves to the universal principles of creation and destruction. By understanding them not as mere chemical reactions but as indicators of deeper forces, we can use them to live more aligned with truth, love, and creation.

The Forgers and the Confusion of Universal Laws
Perhaps forgers are largely responsible for why many people struggle to clearly understand universal laws. Through their deceit and simulations, forgers confuse others, sowing distrust toward genuine feelings. Fear of being deceived can lead people to doubt their natural instincts of solidarity and love, to the point of avoiding helping or empathizing with those in need. In the worst cases, some may even come to believe that following this natural impulse is a grave mistake.

The Responsibility of Forgers
It’s important to understand that forgers are not the origin of evil. Ultimately, they are people who make mistakes. Their disconnection from the creative force leads them to choose paths that will eventually have consequences for themselves. The lies and simulations they practice not only harm others but also distance them from the fulfillment they seek, trapping them in a cycle of dissatisfaction and emptiness.

Error as the Root of Anger and Hate
Error, both in forgers and in those who judge them, is one of the roots of anger and, ultimately, hate. The frustration of discovering deception can cause people to react with rage or distrust, closing themselves off to the possibility of giving love again. This anger is understandable but is also a manifestation of straying from the universal laws of love and creation.

Looking at Ourselves
Before pointing to forgers as the sole culprits, it is essential to reflect on our own actions. Forgery is not an error exclusive to others. At some point, we have all simulated emotions or behaviors that were not entirely sincere. It’s a human mistake we can all commit, whether out of fear, insecurity, or ignorance. Recognizing our own faults allows us to empathize with others and avoid judgment that perpetuates the cycle of hate.

Closing the Circle: Truth and Love as Guides
The way to overcome this confusion is not to reject empathy or distrust love but to strengthen our connection to truth. By understanding that forgers act out of error, we can respond with compassion instead of hate, offering an example of genuine love that can inspire them to change. The force of love not only has the power to create but also to redeem. It is through truth, empathy, and the courage to follow universal laws that we can overcome the fear of deception and realign ourselves with the forces of creation. Only then, as individuals and as humanity, can we build a world based on authentic love and understanding.
