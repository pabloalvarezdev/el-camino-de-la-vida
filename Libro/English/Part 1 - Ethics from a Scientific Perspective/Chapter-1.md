## Chapter 1: Ethics as a Natural Phenomenon

### Justice as a Natural Phenomenon
It is often said that justice is relative and that everyone has their own version of it. Perhaps this is the most difficult myth to debunk. In this chapter, we will attempt to dismantle this notion and offer a much richer and deeper perspective. Justice, far from being a subjective concept that varies between individuals, is a natural phenomenon. All humans understand and feel it, though to varying degrees, depending on their capacity to perceive and process ethical realities. The discrepancies we find about what is just are not because justice is relative, but rather due to our own limitations in intelligence.
### The Apparent Relativity of Justice
When we observe conflicts around justice, it is easy to conclude that there is no single valid answer. This reasoning stems from the fact that just solutions are not always obvious. Differences in opinions do not mean that there is no underlying truth but rather that we often lack the intellectual or emotional tools necessary to reach it.
### Our Limitations
Discrepancies in justice arise, essentially, from our limited ability to resolve complex dilemmas. For example:
•	Lack of understanding: We do not always understand all the factors involved in a situation.
•	Partial perspective: Personal experiences influence how we perceive what is just.
•	Human error: We are swayed by emotions or prejudices that distort our perception of fairness.
### Introducing a Richer Postulate of Justice
As we progress through this chapter, we will explore how justice is an inherent reality of human nature. Although it may seem complex or unattainable in some cases, Justice is not an arbitrary construct. It is a force that we feel and understand to the extent of our intelligence, becoming a constant challenge of refinement. For now, let us leave this idea: justice is not relative but an ideal that exists beyond our differences, waiting for our intelligence to reach it.
If justice were something relative, we would expect that, when asking a diverse group of people about which option is fairer, their answers would be completely arbitrary, without any evident or consistent pattern—something like asking about color preferences. For example, when asking the question, "Which color do you prefer, yellow or green?" we might find that factors such as regional culture, personal experiences, and social influences play a significant role in our preferences. However, there should not be a majority or generalized response favoring one color over the other. Each individual has a unique perception, and what attracts one person may not attract another. This highlights the subjective nature of our choices, where answers are not based on a single absolute truth but on a variety of influences and personal preferences.
However, what we observe with justice is the opposite: in situations where the question is clear, and the circumstances are evident, most people tend to respond similarly, showing remarkable consistency in their perception of what is just.
For example, if we ask a diverse group of people: Which of these two actions seems more unjust?
1.	A poor man without resources stealing oranges to feed his hungry children.
2.	A wealthy doctor stealing kidneys from an unknown person to buy a luxury car.
In this case, the answer seems obvious to most people: the second case is clearly more unjust. This consensus shows that, even in a diverse society with different cultural perspectives, there is a "common sense" that allows us to distinguish between degrees of injustice.
The theft of an organ for personal gain not only violates the dignity and life of another human being but is an act of extreme abuse of power and privilege. On the other hand, the theft of oranges by someone in extreme need is perceived as an act driven by desperation, where the harm caused seems much smaller and is related to a struggle for survival.
This example demonstrates that justice is not completely relative. Although there may be nuances in certain cases, there are situations where the perception of what is just or unjust is universal and deeply rooted in our ethical understanding as human beings.
If, instead, we asked: What is more just?
1.	A country where each person earns exactly what they are capable of producing.
2.	A country where there is a redistribution of wealth to help those who cannot produce.
In this case, the result would be much less clear. The answers would likely be divided, reflecting different perspectives and values. Some might consider it more just for everyone to receive according to their effort and ability, while others would defend the idea of redistributing resources to ensure that no one is left behind, regardless of their circumstances.
This dispersion in responses may seem contradictory. While in the previous example justice seemed evident and universal, in this case, there appears to be no clear consensus. This raises a fascinating puzzle: Why does justice seem so obvious in some situations and so difficult to define in others? Is this proof that justice is relative, or does it simply reflect the complexity of ethical dilemmas?
While it may seem like a contradiction and justice appears relative in certain cases, this pattern is very similar to how humans perceive other objective natural phenomena. To illustrate this, let us consider a simple example:
Imagine we ask: "Which of these colors is darker?"
•	A color that is nearly black.
•	A color that is nearly white.
In this case, the answer would be obvious. Everyone would answer correctly and without hesitation, as the difference between the colors is clear. Human perception aligns with the objective reality of the phenomenon.
But now let us change the scenario. Suppose we present two colors, one green and one blue, both with almost identical levels of brightness. In this case, the answers would be much more confusing and varied. Some people might say the green is darker, others might choose the blue, and others might not be sure. However, this confusion does not mean that darkness or brightness are not natural and objective properties of color. What happens is that respondents lack the ability to distinguish the difference at such a subtle level.
### Justice and Human Perception
In the same way, justice does not cease to be an objective phenomenon simply because humans do not always reach a consensus. In clear and evident situations, as in the examples we have explored (stealing out of greed or stealing out of need), most people agree on what is just. However, in more complex ethical dilemmas, where the factors are more balanced or intertwined, the answers can become confusing. This does not mean that justice is relative but that our ability to perceive and evaluate its nuances is limited, as happens with our perception of colors in the previous example.
### A Universal Phenomenon, But Difficult to Interpret
Just like darkness or brightness, justice is a natural, objective, and universal phenomenon. However, its correct interpretation depends on our ability to analyze it. The more developed our intelligence, empathy, and capacity for reflection, the more accurate we will be in identifying what is just in complex cases. This human limitation does not invalidate the existence of justice as an inherent force in the universe but underscores the importance of deepening our understanding of it.
To arrive at the central postulate of this book, we need to continue using our imagination and explore a few more cases. This will allow us to delve into a key idea: justice is not simply a subjective human perception but a natural phenomenon that transcends our individual interpretations.
Now let us consider another case: What is more just? Saving the life of a 3-year-old child or that of a 90-year-old man?
In general, common sense seems to lean toward saving the child’s life. The reasoning behind this answer lies in the fact that, while the 90-year-old man has already lived a life full of experiences, the child still has an entire future ahead to build. For this reason, saving the child appears more just.
This case leads us to reflect on how our perception of justice does not seem arbitrary but follows patterns that appeal to a shared common sense. Although there are still questions to answer, this example reinforces the idea that justice is not simply a subjective perception but seems to have deeper roots in how we understand the world.
Once again, it seems that justice is not relative in this case. Something within us seems to sense, almost instinctively, what is fair and what is unfair. This sense of justice does not appear to depend on cultural constructions or personal opinions but on a deeper intuition we all share.
Now, let us add a small detail to the previous case: imagine someone tells us that the 90-year-old man was an honorable doctor who saved thousands of lives, while the child, in the future, will become a ruthless psychopath who kills many innocent people. Suddenly, it seems that the fairer option would be to save the elderly man’s life instead of the child’s.
This twist in the situation leads us to ask: does this prove that justice is relative? The answer provided by this book is no. Justice is not relative, but this example helps us delve deeper into its true nature. It confronts us with a dilemma that not only challenges our intuition but also forces us to reflect on what truly determines what is just.
So, if justice is not relative, what is that natural fact that defines it? What underlying principle guides our decisions when we evaluate these dilemmas? To understand this enigma, let us begin to explore other areas of this field.
### Create and Destroy: The Great Key to Ethics
Humans have an innate attraction to creation and an equally innate aversion to destruction. This principle, in its most generic form, encompasses everything from creating human life, molding a vase, or building a friendship, to the opposite extreme: taking a life, breaking an object, or losing a meaningful connection. Essentially, creating generates a sense of purpose and connection, while destruction tends to provoke a sense of emptiness or loss.
I know many of you may be thinking: “That’s not true; there are people who seem to enjoy destroying or even killing.” And, in a way, you are right. This is an important point that we will address later. However, before moving forward, I’d like to ask you as readers: Do you identify with this attraction toward creation and this aversion to destruction?
In our daily experience, it seems clear that most of us feel a special satisfaction when creating something new, whether it is a work, an idea, or a relationship. Similarly, we tend to feel pain or regret when witnessing destruction, especially if we are responsible for it.
But if this attraction to creation and rejection of destruction is so natural, why is the world so full of destruction? This is the enigma we will attempt to address in the following reflections. We will explore how, despite our creative nature, humans often become entangled in forces that promote destruction, and what role ethics plays in this apparent internal conflict.
Can We Measure Love and Hate?
If these forces are truly natural, why are we unable to measure or empirically prove them? At first glance, this seems like a valid critique, but, in reality, empirical evidence of these forces is almost constantly present in our lives.
### Love as a Visible Creator
Love, as a creative force, is tangibly manifested in countless aspects of human existence:
•	Love between partners leads to the creation of new lives. That is, people who love each other have children.
•	Love for art motivates painters to paint, musicians to compose songs, and writers to fill pages.
•	Love for others builds friendships, caring relationships, and communities.
In every act of creation, love leaves a visible and measurable trace, even though the force driving it may not be so easily captured by scientific instruments.
### Hate as a Tangible Destroyer
Hate, on the other hand, is also undeniably observable in its destructive effects:
•	Hate between individuals or nations generates murders, wars, and devastation.
•	Hate toward oneself or others produces isolation, broken relationships, and acts of violence.
•	Hate for life or nature leads to the destruction of the environment and resources that sustain existence.
Denying the reality of these forces is almost ridiculous. Although we cannot "measure" love and hate directly as we would a physical force, their effects are as evident as the wind, which we do not see but feel, or gravity, which we cannot touch but perceive in every falling object.
### Love and Hate: Universal Laws of Tangible Effects
Love and hate are fundamental principles operating in the realm of creation and destruction, leaving clear and observable marks on the world. While we cannot encapsulate them in a mathematical formula, their effects are so constant and universal that attempting to deny them would ignore reality itself. These phenomena are an inherent part of existence, like other laws of nature that govern our lives.
So why can’t we measure love and hate directly? The reason is that these forces do not operate within the four dimensions our senses perceive: length, height, depth, and time. Instead, love and hate manifest in a different dimension, one that activates when our intelligence reaches a sufficient level to remember the past and foresee the future.
### The Ethical Dimension: The Gateway to Love and Hate
This new dimension, which we might call the ethical dimension, appears the moment we become aware that our actions have consequences beyond the present instant. When we understand that what we do today will impact both ourselves and others in the future, these forces begin to have a tangible effect on our decisions.
It is in this dimension that love and hate act:
•	Love pushes us to think about how our actions can build, benefit, and give continuity to what we value.
•	Hate tempts us toward destruction, toward decisions that break, harm, or eliminate what we do not wish to preserve.
### Intelligence and the Perception of These Forces
The more intelligent a being is, the more clearly it can perceive these forces. This happens because intelligence allows us to project our actions into the future and evaluate their possible outcomes. The more we think about our decisions, the more intensely we feel the effects of love and hate.
A daily example illustrates this: a person who reflects deeply on the impact of their actions on others will be more inclined to act from love, while someone who ignores these consequences may more easily fall under the influence of hate.
### The Ethical Dimension: The Awareness of Consequences
The ethical dimension arises when intelligence becomes aware that its actions have consequences. It is at this moment that decisions cease to be simply immediate reactions and become conscious choices that affect both the individual and the environment. This awareness gives rise to the perception of two forces that guide our actions: love and hate.
Love presents itself as a constructive force, attracting us toward creation, toward everything that strengthens, builds, and unites. It is the energy that inspires us to create, to seek the common good, and to contribute positively to the world around us. Hate, on the other hand, is a destructive force that pulls us away from creation and drives us toward destruction. It separates us, divides us, and pushes us toward chaos and disintegration.
Feelings are our tool for perceiving these forces. They allow us to feel the presence of these forces in our decisions and actions. As intelligence becomes aware of the consequences of its choices, it begins to feel the repercussions of those actions, both within itself and in the external world. At this point, love inspires us to create and build, while hate drives us toward destruction.
Intelligence, therefore, does not merely process information but becomes a fundamental instrument for predicting the consequences of our actions and guiding us toward one of these two forces. By becoming aware of these forces and their effects, we are capable of making decisions more aligned with principles that promote creation and well-being while avoiding those that lead to destruction and suffering.
In this sense, the ethical dimension is not just an abstract concept but a lived and felt reality, where intelligence becomes the compass guiding our decisions, and feelings show us the path toward creation or destruction.
### Intelligence as the Gateway to Ethical Perception
Without intelligence, these forces would not be perceived. Feelings emerge when intelligence acts as a bridge between the ethical dimension and our physical organism. It is our ability to reflect, to remember the past and foresee the future, that translates these forces into emotions we experience in our daily lives.
For example:
•	When we build something valuable or protect a relationship, we feel satisfaction because we perceive we are aligned with the force of love.
•	When we intentionally destroy something or break a bond, we feel guilt or remorse because our intelligence detects we have fallen under the influence of hate.
### Beyond Biology
Although feelings have a chemical correlate in the body (hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.), this perspective proposes that these physical reactions are merely biological responses to a feeling that results from intelligence. Just as the eye does not create light but perceives it, our brain and body do not create love or hate; instead, they experience them as part of a much larger universe.
This idea redefines feelings as a system of perception that connects our physical existence to the universal forces of love and hate, giving them a much more transcendent purpose than we usually imagine.
### The Induction of Love and Hate: The Inertia of Their Actions
A fundamental factor in love and hate is how they are transmitted. These forces propagate through intelligent beings in a way reminiscent of how a magnet can induce magnetism in a piece of soft iron. When a person is exposed to actions influenced by hate, the natural tendency is for that exposure to generate hate within them. On the contrary, if that same person is exposed to acts guided by love, it is likely that love will emerge within them.
### The Induction of Hate
Hate has a disturbing ability to spread beyond its point of origin. For example, someone may be subjected to hurtful or defamatory words from a person filled with hate. These actions not only cause pain and resentment in the recipient but also extend to others who have no relationship with the origin of this destructive energy. Thus, a wound inflicted by one person can reverberate through loved ones or even strangers, creating a perpetuating cycle of hate.
### The Induction of Love
Love, on the other hand, has an opposite but equally expansive effect. When a person experiences acts of kindness, compassion, or generosity, that love can awaken within them and flow toward others. This “inertia of love” effect is not limited to the person who initiated the action but can radiate toward others, generating a virtuous circle of connection and care.
### The Inertia of Forces
One of the most critical aspects of this induction is the inertia that accompanies these forces. Once love or hate has been induced in a person, its influence does not stop with that individual. Actions carried out under the influence of these forces can impact others, perpetuating their effect across time and space. It is as though every intelligent being acts as a transmitter and amplifier of these fundamental energies.
For example:
•	A father who experiences hate in his work environment may, unintentionally, spill that hate onto his family, creating tensions and conflicts.
•	On the other hand, a person who receives an unexpected act of love or kindness may replicate that gesture, even toward individuals who have no connection to the person who initiated the action.
### A Cycle That Builds or Destroys
This phenomenon largely explains how the forces of love and hate shape human life and social dynamics. They are forces with a high capacity for contagion, capable of building or destroying, depending on which one predominates. Understanding this mechanism allows us to become aware of the responsibility we have for the emotions and actions we propagate, knowing that every act influenced by love or hate has the potential to resonate beyond ourselves.
### Ethics as an Innate Tool for Promoting Creation and Existence
The human effort to find ethics and values is nothing more than humanity’s attempt to establish a set of rules and mechanisms that allow the creative force of love to overcome the destructive force. This ethics, as an innate tool, aims to ensure that humans endure in harmony, avoiding a cycle of hate and destruction that could, ultimately, end humanity itself.
Through ethics, humans seek not only physical survival but also the preservation of their soul and spirit, aligning themselves with the divine to avoid self-destruction. Ethics thus becomes the guardian that guides human actions, allowing love and creation to prevail over chaos and disintegration.
### Justice Based on Impact
At this point, we are in a position to explain what makes one option more just than another. We consider an option just when its action produces a net effect that is more constructive or less destructive than the other.
Justice, therefore, is not based solely on an arbitrary choice but on the real impact of actions. The most just option is the one that contributes positively, promotes creation, and minimizes damage or destruction, fostering collective well-being and harmony in the universe.
