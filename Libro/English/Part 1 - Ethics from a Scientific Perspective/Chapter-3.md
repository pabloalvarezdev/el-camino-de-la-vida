## Chapter 3: Love as the Only Path to Happiness

### Happiness as the Result of Creation
For many years, people have sought to understand what truly makes us happy. While there are many debates on this topic, here we associate happiness with the result of creation in its most global sense. True happiness arises when our actions contribute to the process of creation and the well-being of all, aligning us with the creative force that drives the universe.

### The Inherent Feeling of Happiness in Creation
Humans experience an inherent feeling of happiness when creating something new, whether it is something tangible like a work of art, something alive like a child, or something intangible like a friendship. This ability to shape what did not exist before, to bring something into the world, generates profound satisfaction and a sense of connection with creation itself. The happiness derived from creation does not depend on the object itself but on the act of generating something that brings value and purpose, aligning with the creative force of the universe.

### The Difference Between Happiness and Pleasure
One crucial distinction we must understand is the difference between happiness and pleasure. Their relationship does not depend on the duration of satisfaction but rather on the dimension they affect. Happiness is directly related to love and creation, while pleasure is more biological in nature.
This does not mean that pleasure is inherently bad or opposed to happiness. What it means is that pleasure that is not oriented toward creation or love will not yield lasting results. Moreover, it is common to find people who confuse the concept of happiness with pleasure. When trying to achieve happiness solely through pleasure, they fail to sustain satisfaction and end up overindulging in pleasurable actions to maintain it over time. Often, these excesses turn into highly destructive behaviors, both to themselves and to their surroundings.
This does not make them inherently bad people; their problem lies in mistaking the path to happiness. Recognizing this distinction allows us to better align our actions with the higher dimensions of love and creation, ensuring that we pursue not just momentary pleasure but lasting and meaningful fulfillment.

### Destruction and Suffering
Conversely, destruction or the death of something can only result in suffering and unhappiness. When something is destroyed or lost—whether it is a creation, a life, or a relationship—the result is an absence that causes pain and emptiness. Destruction disrupts the natural cycle of creation and, instead of fostering growth, produces negative energy that distances us from well-being and harmony.

### Destruction and Regret

Destruction, in any form, is never a source of happiness because it goes against the creative force that guides intelligence toward love and harmony. Destruction, within an ethical framework, can only be justified as a last resort when its purpose is to prevent a greater harm that would cause more suffering, and only when no other viable option exists.
The only reason an agent engages in destruction is due to unawareness of the suffering it has caused.
However, the moment the agent becomes aware of the suffering it has generated or realizes that the destruction was unnecessary, they will experience automatic repentance for their action.
Destructive Actions Driven by Hate
Destructive actions motivated by hate never produce true satisfaction. Instead, they generate a perverse feeling of satisfaction derived from the destruction caused. However, this sensation goes against the fundamental laws of creation. A destructive action driven by hate generates two main reactions:

An inherent aversion in all conscious beings to the reason behind the destructive action, as hate opposes the natural order of life.
A disturbance within the destructive agent. This disturbance arises from the internal conflict of acting against the principles of creation and universal harmony. This disturbance will be explained in detail in the following section.
The Disturbance of Hate
Existence itself requires creation; it is the natural and predominant force in nature. Intelligent beings do not act as independent, isolated elements; they are influenced by their environment, and their decisions result from the consensus of their thoughts (like neurons in the brain). When a person is consumed by hate, they enter a state of partial instability. Part of their essence desires hate, while another part longs for creation.

This internal conflict generates emotional and psychological strain that, over time, becomes unsustainable. Hate consumes vital energy, destabilizing the individual. On the other hand, a person focused exclusively on creation lives in harmony with themselves, their environment, and the universe. Aligned with the forces of creation, they experience peace, stability, and well-being, both internally and externally.

### Hate: An Uncontrollable Destructive Effect
Hate not only prevents happiness but also generates an inherent rejection from external beings. Additionally, hate possesses inertia and acts destructively, not only against potential "adversaries" but far beyond them. The destructive seed of hate cannot be controlled. In the face of any setback, instead of reflecting and acting proactively, hate injects its destructive flow into those around the individual, negatively affecting even those closest and dearest to them.

This effect is particularly pernicious because hate does not discriminate: it harms both "enemies" and those who should be protected and loved, thereby amplifying its destructive impact unsustainably. Hate not only feeds on itself but also induces hate in nearby beings, who, in turn, return it with a destructive effect. This creates a spiral of destruction, where the bearer of hate becomes the first victim of their own emotional burden. This perpetual cycle of hate not only destroys others but also consumes the individual internally, leading to emotional and relational self-destruction.

### Love: The Path to Happiness
What was explained in the previous section is reversed reciprocally in the case of love. Love translates into creation, generating a feeling of happiness and harmony with the universe. When giving love, people respond with love, creating a chain reaction that increases happiness and creation in the environment. This positive cycle reinforces collective well-being, creating a deep connection with others and with the surroundings.

### Why Does Hate Exist if Happiness is the Ultimate Goal?
The primary cause of hate lies in actions driven by anger. Anger, in turn, always arises from a mistake. This mistake may be caused by others, by oneself, or even by a lie that leads to error. From this error, episodes of hate can emerge, where even innocent elements, such as children or animals, may become victims.

### Why People Mistakenly Seek Satisfaction
Many people mistakenly seek satisfaction in aspects that seem similar to happiness but are, in reality, not aligned with the universal forces of love and creation. This happens because there are feelings that appear similar but are opposite in essence. These can provide a temporary sense of satisfaction but not the fulfillment that comes from being in harmony with the natural laws of the universe. One of the clearest examples is the difference between honor and arrogance.

### Honor and Arrogance: A Comparison
Honor: Creation and Admiration
Honor is the result of acting in alignment with truth and love, even in adverse situations. It is a feeling born from having done the right thing, having contributed to the well-being of others, or having remained faithful to universal principles without expecting anything in return.

Characteristics of honor:
Generates genuine admiration from others.
Can exist in poverty, defeat, or adversity.
Strengthens human connections, fostering respect and trust.
Is independent of material outcomes; it arises from effort and intention.
For example, a scientist who dedicates their life to researching a cure for a disease, without seeking personal recognition, acts with honor. Even if they do not achieve success during their lifetime, their dedication will be remembered with admiration.

Arrogance: Appearance and Rejection
Arrogance, in contrast, is a superficial feeling born from excessive ego and disconnection from the creative forces. It is often associated with material achievements or positions of power but lacks the depth that honor provides. Instead of generating admiration, arrogance produces rejection and isolation.

Characteristics of arrogance:
Seeks external validation, not internal satisfaction.
Is tied to material success or superficial recognition.
Often results in broken relationships or envy, as it lacks authenticity.
Is fleeting and fragile, relying on external factors that may vanish.
For example, a businessperson who accumulates wealth by exploiting others may temporarily enjoy the flattery of those around them for self-interest, but they will lack genuine respect from people and a real connection with love and creation.

### More Examples of Contrasts: True and False
Generosity vs. Disguised Self-Centeredness

Generosity: Helping others with resources or time without expecting anything in return, motivated by the desire to create a positive impact.
Disguised self-centeredness: Acting “generously” only to receive recognition or manipulate others, distorting the act of genuine love.
True Love vs. Possessiveness

True love: Is selfless, seeks the well-being of the other, and is aligned with the forces of creation.
Possessiveness: Seeks to control the other, disguising selfishness and fear as love, which destroys relationships and causes suffering.
Confidence vs. Arrogance

Confidence: Stems from self-knowledge and respect for oneself and others. It is a balanced feeling that fosters cooperation.
Arrogance: Is an excess of ego that lacks respect for others and often leads to rejection and isolation.
### Egocentrism: The Great Misguide
Egocentrism is the root of many human errors. It is a focus on the “self” that disconnects people from the universal forces of love and creation, leading them to seek satisfaction in superficial and destructive emotions. Egocentrism drives people to:

Seek external validation: Instead of finding fulfillment in their own actions and principles, they seek approval from others to feel valuable.
Prioritize material success: Happiness is measured by possessions or achievements, ignoring the inner wealth that comes from authentic creation.
Avoid vulnerability: Egocentric people fear showing weakness or making mistakes, distancing themselves from empathy and genuine connection.
### How to Redirect the Path to True Happiness
Reflect on motivations: Ask whether the actions we take align with love and creation or whether they seek superficial recognition.
Value the intangible: Recognize that genuine admiration, trust, and respect are more valuable than any material success.
Embrace vulnerability: Accepting our imperfections and learning from them connects us more deeply with others and ourselves.
Distinguish between the temporary and the enduring: Arrogance, possessiveness, and ego are fleeting; honor, genuine love, and generosity are eternal.

### Conclusion
The pursuit of satisfaction can lead us down paths that seem similar but have opposite destinations. While honor, generosity, and authentic love align us with universal forces, arrogance, egocentrism, and possessiveness divert us toward an emptiness that can never be filled. The key is to recognize these contrasts and consciously choose actions that connect us to love, truth, and creation.
