## Chapter 9: The Origin of Conflict—Resources and Sustainability
We have deeply reflected on the nature of intelligent beings and arrived at a fundamental conclusion: humankind is not inherently evil. Hatred is not an innate force; it is, in essence, a consequence of error. And errors arise from egocentrism, which is fueled by fear and the instinct for self-preservation.

Egocentrism and the Protective Instinct as the Root of Conflict
Egocentrism—this excessive focus on oneself or particular interests—does not stem from a desire to harm but from a limited perception. Intelligent beings, inspired by love and creation, yearn to exist and contribute to the universe. But when fear takes hold, the instinct for self-preservation may lead them to prioritize their immediate survival over the greater good.

### This is where errors begin.

The protective instinct, while essential for survival, becomes problematic when it is disproportionate or misdirected.
When combined with the perception of scarcity, this instinct can result in conflicts over the resources needed to create and exist.
Conflict as a Consequence of Scarcity
The most basic origin of conflict is not hatred but the limitation of resources. Intelligent beings require resources to manifest their capacity for creation, and when these resources seem insufficient, struggle arises. This conflict is not an end in itself but a reaction to the fear of being unable to exist or create.

The paradox is that while intelligent beings desire to add value to the universe, conflict over resources leads to destruction. The potential to build is eclipsed by the need to protect what little is perceived as available. This is the dilemma that must be overcome for intelligences to transcend.

### Intelligence as the Solution to Conflict
A truly intelligent being is one that can avoid this initial conflict. The formula is absolute: create sustainably. Sustainability is not merely a strategy; it is a universal principle that ensures creation does not deplete original resources but enriches them.

When the sum of creative actions generates more resources than it consumes, a state of balance is achieved that allows all intelligent beings to thrive.

Create with efficiency and efficacy:

Use resources optimally, ensuring each creation adds more value than it consumes.
Design systems where waste is minimized, and creations are recycled or repurposed.
Reuse creations that no longer function:

To discard does not mean to destroy; it means to transform the obsolete into something new and valuable.
The ability to reinvent what already exists is a mark of true intelligence.
### Collaboration and Cooperation as Catalysts for Happiness
Intelligence does not operate in isolation. Collaboration and cooperation not only make intelligences more efficient but also maximize the happiness of the system as a whole. By working together, intelligent beings can share resources, ideas, and results, generating a greater and more sustainable impact.

Collaboration: Creating together, leveraging individual strengths to build something greater than the sum of its parts.
Cooperation: Helping others to thrive, recognizing that their well-being is intrinsically connected to our own.
When intelligence understands that true success lies not in competing for limited resources but in cooperating to generate abundance, the door opens to a spiral of creation, peace, and happiness.

### Conclusion
The origin of conflict lies in the perception of scarcity, but its solution lies in sustainable creation. Intelligent beings are not inherently destructive; they are inspired by love and creation. When resources are used efficiently, and intelligences cooperate, not only is conflict avoided, but happiness is maximized for all.

Sustainability is not just an ideal; it is the key to building a universe where creation is infinite, and harmony prevails. A truly intelligent being does not merely avoid conflict; they transform the universe's resources into opportunities to build a better future.
