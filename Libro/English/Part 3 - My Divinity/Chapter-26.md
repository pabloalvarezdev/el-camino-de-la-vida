## Chapter 26: The Meaning of Life

If there is something that has been deeply healing and comforting for me, it is having found meaning in life. A reason to wake up every morning and live fully. Defining this meaning is no simple task. Saying that it is to obey God might sound like a form of submission. Talking about living in harmony with the universe could seem too abstract or metaphysical. Perhaps, the clearest way to express it is to say that the meaning of life, for me, is to live ethically. Living ethically means guiding every action toward justice that is not just earthly but divine or universal, depending on how one chooses to interpret it. While these words may carry different connotations for each person, for me, they are one and the same truth.

### Human Imperfection and the Right Direction
This does not mean that I must be perfect. I am human, with limited intelligence, subject to biological desires and chemical needs. Acknowledging these limitations does not exempt me from the responsibility of always orienting my actions toward principles that I hold sacred: love, justice, and truth. Making mistakes is inevitable but not definitive. If I err, I do not consider myself condemned. However, it is essential that, upon recognizing an error, I allow the feeling of repentance to arise within me. This repentance is not punishment but a signal guiding me back to the right path, realigning my actions with what must be the meaning of life.

### A Symbolic Vision of Purpose
Sometimes, to express this idea, I turn to a more symbolic vision. I imagine a moment when God sits beside me, places an arm around my shoulders, and says tenderly: "This is the world I have created, and these are all my children. Treat them with the respect they deserve as part of my creation." This simple gesture contains a powerful truth: our life is not just our own. We are part of something much greater, and every action we take affects the delicate balance of this world and those who inhabit it.

### Correcting Without Judging
This respect for others does not imply tolerating everything without discernment. It means recognizing my role in life. I have not come to judge or punish, but to fulfill the will of the Creator and, as much as possible, help others fulfill it too. Speaking the truth and correcting with love is not incompatible with this purpose; on the contrary, it is an expression of it. However, this correction must be guided by empathy and understanding, not by arrogance or the desire to impose. Respect for others' dignity and humility in recognizing my own limitations are fundamental to fulfilling this role.

### Final Reflection: A Purpose in Communion
The meaning of life is not something imposed from outside, nor something that can be reduced to a single definition. It is a communion between our human nature and the creative force that gives us purpose. Living ethically, feeling proud of every action I guide toward love and justice, and correcting my mistakes with humility are the ways I find meaning and fulfillment. It is an imperfect path but one that is deeply human and divine at the same time. Imagining that God, with His infinite love, trusts me to care for His creation and my fellow beings is a thought that inspires and guides me. My purpose is not to judge or punish but to walk alongside others, helping them find their own meaning in life as we all seek to live in harmony with the universe and in service to God.
